# 💱 Simple Currency Converter

A responsive and lightweight **Currency Converter** web application built using **React**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. The app allows users to convert between different currencies in real-time using exchange rate data fetched from an external API.

## 🌟 Features

- 💸 Real-time currency conversion using external APIs.
- 🌐 Select currencies and input amount for instant conversion.
- 🎯 Clean, minimal, and responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS.
- ♻️ Built with reusable and modular React components for better maintainability.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project helped me explore and understand several key concepts in modern React development:

### 📡 API Fetching
- Learned how to fetch and display real-time data using `fetch()` and `async/await`.
- Handled API responses, loading states, and errors gracefully in a user-friendly way.

### 🧩 Reusable Components
- Broke down the UI into small, maintainable, and reusable components such as:
  - Currency selector dropdown
  - Input field component
  - Result display
- Promoted DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles in the codebase.

### 🔁 Virtual DOM vs Real DOM
- Understood how React's **Virtual DOM** optimizes rendering by updating only the parts of the DOM that change.
- Compared with the **Real DOM**, which is slower when dealing with frequent updates.
- Gained insight into how React boosts performance through virtual DOM diffing and reconciliation.
