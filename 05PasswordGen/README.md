# 🔐  Password Generator (React App)

A modern web application built using **React**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This project combines two essential utilities:


- A **Password Generator** with custom options to generate strong, secure passwords.

## 🚀 Features

### 🔐 Password Generator
- User-defined **password length**.
- Toggle options to include:
  - **Numbers**
  - **Alphabets**
- **Copy to Clipboard** button to quickly copy the generated password.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project deepened my understanding of React fundamentals, especially around **Hooks**. Here's what I explored and implemented:

- **`useState`** – Managing input values, password settings, and dynamic UI states.
- **`useEffect`** – Handling side-effects such as syncing the password whenever settings change.
- **`useRef`** – Referencing the password input field to copy it programmatically.
- **`useCallback`** – Optimizing password generation and copy functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

### 🧩 Key Takeaways
- Hooks are powerful tools that simplify logic and allow for more modular and readable components.
- Custom hooks and optimized callbacks greatly improve app performance and maintainability.
